The need for a common pltform to guide practitioners in food and nutrition has been a reference platform where they can know where nutritive food products can be found. 
The iFoodSOS is deveveloped as the go-to co-created knowledge center for an Integrated Food Sustainability Operating System. We shall provide processes that facilitate access for FarmHubs and FoodFarmacies. It integrates geo-spatial solutions that support small, medium or large-case farmers. It provides a platform for people to develop data use cases on food and nutrition within the wider food system
