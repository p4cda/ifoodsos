The need for a common platform to guide practitioners in food and nutrition has been loudly voiced in development space. No reference platform existed where practitioners can learn and use a process anchored knowledge platform where data on nutritive food and agriculture driven health products can be found. 

The iFoodSOS is deveveloped as the go-to co-created knowledge center for an Integrated Food Sustainability Operating System. We  provide processes that facilitate access to FarmHubs (owned by producers) and FoodFarmacies (owned by consumers). 

It integrates blockchain anchored geo-spatial solutions that support small, medium or large-case farmers. It provides a platform for people to develop data use cases on food and nutrition within the wider food system.
